# Inventory Management Policy

## Stock Level Guidelines
- Maintain minimum 2 weeks of inventory for fast-moving items
- Slow movers should not exceed 8 weeks of stock on hand
- Reorder points should be set at 150% of lead time demand

## Markdown Strategy
- Items with zero sales in 60 days should be marked down 20%
- After 90 days with no sales, apply 40% markdown
- Final clearance at 60% off after 120 days

## Stockout Prevention
- High-risk items (less than 7 days of stock) require immediate attention
- Emergency orders can be placed with 24-48 hour delivery for critical SKUs
- Substitute products should be identified for top-selling items

## Seasonal Guidelines
- Q4 inventory levels should be 150% of normal to handle holiday demand
- Post-holiday clearance begins January 2nd with progressive markdowns
- Summer clearance starts July 15th for seasonal merchandise
